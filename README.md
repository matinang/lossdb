reserve
========================================================

reserve is designed to analyze the outstanding loss reserve applicable to a line of business of an insurance company.  The package has 3 main objectives:
 
 * To create a consistent framework for working with raw claims loss detail.
 * To summarize and compare claims loss detail at different evaluation dates. (e.g. check that new data is reasonable when data from a new evaluation date is added to the data base)
 * To work with available R resources to create ultimate loss projections and summary reserve report exhibits.
 
reserve is still in very early stages of development, and this is my first R package.  I appreciate any advice.
