reserve
========================================================

reserve is designed to analyze the outstanding loss applicable to a line of business of an insurance company.  The package has 3 main objectives:
 
 * To Create a consistent framework for working with claims loss detail
 * To Summarize and compare claims loss detail at different evaluation dates. (e.g. check that new data is reasonable when data from a new evaluation date is added to the data base)
 * Work with available R resources to create ultimate loss projections and summary reserve report exhibits.
 
reserve is still in very early stages of development, and this is my first R package.  I appreciate any advice you can provide.
