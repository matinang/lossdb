reserve
========================================================

reserve is designed to be used to analyze the outstanding loss applicable to a line of business of an insurance company.  The package has 3 main applications:
 
 * The package summarizes and compares the claims loss detail from one evaluation date to the next to check for inconsistencies in the data.
 * It formats the data and works with the ChainLadder package to create projections for ultimate losses.
 * Creates summary exhibits for a reserve report.
 
reserve is still in very early stages of development.  I would not recommend using it, but feel free to fork it, and commit your edits.
